                 2024. This Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) manufactured crew module had its first un-crewed experimental flight on 18 December
                  2014. As of May 2019, design of the crew module has been completed. Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) will provide 
                  support for critical human-centric systems and technologies like space grade food, crew healthcare, radiation measurement and protection,

        <h3 class="abc"><b>A crewed spacecraft would require about <mark>₹12,400 crore (US$1.77 billion) over a period of seven years</mark>, including the ₹5,000 crore (US$0.7 billion) for the initial work of the crewed spacecraft during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2007–2012) out of which the Government released ₹ 50 crore (US$7 million) in 2007–2008. In December 2018, the government approved further ₹10,000 crore (US$1.5 billion) for a 7-days crewed flight of 3 astronauts to take place by 2021.
            <mark>Madhavan Chandradathan, director of Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC)</mark>, stated that ISRO would need to set up an astronaut training facility in Bangalore. Newly established Human Space Flight Centre (HSFC) will coordinate the IHSF efforts. Existing launch facilities will be upgraded for launches under Indian Human Spaceflight project  with extra facilities needed for launch escape systems. Russia is likely to provide astronaut training. In spring 2009, the full-scale mock-up of crew capsule of Gaganyaan was built and delivered to Satish Dhawan Space Centre for training of astronauts. 
            India has already successfully developed and tested several building blocks, including re-entry space capsule, pad abort test, safe crew ejection mechanism in case of rocket failure, flight suit developed by Defence Bioengineering and Electromedical Laboratory (DEBEL) and the powerful GSLV-MkIII launch vehicle. Having met all required technological keystones, the Indian Human Spaceflight Programme was accepted and formally announced by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 15 August 2018. Gaganyaan will be the first crewed spacecraft under this programme.
            ISRO's Human Space Flight Centre and Glavcosmos, which is a subsidiary of the Russian state corporation Roscosmos, signed an agreement on 1 July 2019 for cooperation in the selection, support, medical examination and space training of Indian astronauts. An ISRO Technical Liaison Unit (ITLU) has been approved to be set up in Moscow for cordination. Glavkosmos has also contracted NPP Zvezda for manufacturing customized IVA flight-suits for Indian astronauts. ISRO is planning to develop a ground station for Gaganyaan mission at Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and 
            after a brief discussion with Australian Space Agency, a temporary ground station for the mission has been set up by ISRO in Cocos (Keeling) Islands, as of 2021.</b></h3>
        <h1 style="text-align: center;"><u>2 modules of Gaganyaan</u></h1><br>
        <u><h2 style="padding-left: 50px;">Crew Module:-</h2></u>
        <h3 class="abc"><b>Gaganyaan crew module is a fully autonomous 5.3 t (12,000 lb) spacecraft designed to carry a <mark>3-member crew</mark> to orbit and safely return to the Earth after a mission duration of up to seven days. The crew module is equipped with two parachutes for redundancy, while one parachute is good enough for safe splashdown. The parachutes would reduce the speed of the crew module from over 216 m/s (710 ft/s) to under 11 m/s (36 ft/s) at splashdown.
          The space capsule will have life support and environmental control systems. It will be equipped with emergency mission abort and a Crew Escape System (CES) that can be activated during the first stage or second rocket stage burn. The nose of the original version of the orbital vehicle was free for a docking mechanism, but primary entry was evidently through a side hatch secured by explosive bolts.</b></h3><br>
        <h2 style="padding-left: 50px;"><u>Service Module:-</u></h2>
        <h3 class="abc"><b>Its 2.9 t (6,400 lb) service module is powered by liquid propellant engines. The crew module is mated to the service module, and together they constitute 8.2 t (18,000 lb) orbital module.
          The Service Module Propulsion System (SMPS) will help in orbit raising maneuver of Gaganyaan to reach 400 km in low earth orbit (LEO) and remain connected during deorbit burn until atmospheric reentry. It will use an unified bipropellant system consisting of MON-3 and Monomethylhydrazine as oxidizer and fuel, having five main engines derived from ISRO's liquid apogee motor with 440 N (99 lbf) thrust and sixteen 100 N reaction control system (RCS) thrusters.
          Upon reentry, Service Module will detach itself from the spacecraft.
